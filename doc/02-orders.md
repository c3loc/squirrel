# Orders

Squirrel makes some assumptions about workflows, which are put into code in the order state.

## Order states

### Requested

Once an order is put in, it is in **requested** state. The Einkauf has
not yet taken a look at it. In this state, you can change your order at
any time.

### Approved

Your order was approved by the Einkauf and will be handled. If you want
to change something about your order, you need to contact the Einkauf
directly via DECT ORDER.

### Delivered

Your order has been delivered and commissioned. It can be picked up any
time at the LOC Helpdesk.

### Completed

Your order has been picked up.
